# Hotel Cancellation Analysis in Excel

## Overview
This README document provides instructions and details on how to conduct a hotel cancellation analysis using Excel. The goal of this analysis is to understand the patterns and factors contributing to hotel booking cancellations.

## Prerequisites
Before starting the analysis, ensure you have the following:
- Microsoft Excel installed on your computer.
- Hotel booking dataset (preferably in CSV format) that includes details such as booking dates, customer demographics, booking status, etc.

## Steps to Perform Hotel Cancellation Analysis

### 1. Importing Data
1. Open Microsoft Excel.
2. Go to `File` > `Open` and select your dataset (CSV file).
3. Excel will display the data in a spreadsheet format.

### 2. Data Cleaning
Ensure the dataset is clean and ready for analysis:
1. Remove any duplicate entries.
2. Check for and handle missing values. This can be done by either removing incomplete rows or filling missing values with appropriate data.
3. Standardize the date formats for consistency.

### 3. Creating a Pivot Table
Pivot Tables are useful for summarizing data:
1. Select the entire dataset.
2. Go to `Insert` > `PivotTable`.
3. Choose where you want the PivotTable report to be placed (new worksheet is recommended).
4. In the PivotTable Fields pane, drag and drop fields to Rows, Columns, and Values to summarize data. For example:
   - Rows: `Booking Status` (to distinguish between cancellations and non-cancellations).
   - Columns: `Hotel Type`, `Month`, `Customer Segment` (or other relevant fields).
   - Values: `Count of Bookings` or `Sum of Amount Spent`.

### 4. Analyzing Booking Cancellations
To gain insights into booking cancellations:
1. Filter the PivotTable to show only cancelled bookings.
2. Analyze the number of cancellations by different categories such as hotel type, booking month, customer segment, etc.
3. Identify patterns, such as peak cancellation periods or specific customer demographics with higher cancellation rates.

### 5. Visualizing Data
Create charts to visualize the findings:
1. Select the data or PivotTable you want to visualize.
2. Go to `Insert` > choose a chart type (e.g., Bar Chart, Line Chart, Pie Chart).
3. Customize the chart by adding titles, labels, and legends for better clarity.
4. Example visualizations:
   - Bar Chart showing the number of cancellations per month.
   - Pie Chart showing the percentage of cancellations by customer segment.

### 6. Advanced Analysis (Optional)
For deeper analysis, you can use the following techniques:
1. **Correlation Analysis**: Use Excelâ€™s `CORREL` function to find correlations between cancellations and other variables (e.g., room price, lead time).
2. **Regression Analysis**: Use the Data Analysis Toolpak to perform regression analysis and identify factors that significantly impact cancellations.

### 7. Reporting
Summarize the findings in a report:
1. Create a new worksheet for the report.
2. Include key metrics and visualizations.
3. Write a brief analysis for each finding, explaining the trends and potential reasons behind them.

## Example Analysis Workflow
1. Import dataset `hotel_bookings.csv`.
2. Clean the data by removing duplicates and handling missing values.
3. Create a PivotTable to summarize booking status by hotel type and month.
4. Filter PivotTable to show cancellations and analyze the patterns.
5. Visualize the data using bar charts and pie charts.
6. (Optional) Perform correlation and regression analysis.
7. Compile a report with key insights and visualizations.

## Conclusion
By following these steps, you can effectively analyze hotel booking cancellations using Excel. This analysis helps in identifying trends and factors influencing cancellations, enabling better decision-making for hotel management and strategy development.
